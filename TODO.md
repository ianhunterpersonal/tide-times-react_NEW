# TODOs

1. Reduce space required for tide display - reduce font, provide visual styles for tide height. Perhaps not use tide height as primary indicator - just color.
1. Provide a way to see tides for yesterday, today and tomorrow. - as many days as is practical on the display. Use multiple calls to server for the moment

    | 11/11/18        | 12/11/18    | 13/11/18  |
    | -------------   |:-----------:| ---------:|
    | 00:13           | 00:13       | 00:13     |
    | 06:45           | 06:45       | 06:45     |
    | 12:55           | 12:55       | 12:55     |  
    | 18:55           | 18:55       | 18:55     |

    Each cell is coloured to indicate low/high tide

2. Add special shading for today column to highlight it
3. Add many more sites.
4. Allow filtre search for sites - could be huge
5. Allow user to select favourites
6. Display favorites on TABs for easy access - up to 4 (say)
